# TicTacToe
TicTacToe playable either using pygame or straight from the command line. Gives the option to play against another player locally, or against the computer. When playing against the computer, you always play as 'O'.

To begin the game, simply `pip install requirements.txt` (or just `pip install pygame`) and execute main.py.
